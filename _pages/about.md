## Does AI pose a threat in the modern day?

# YES.

### Deepfakes

There has been a fast growing production of non-consensual, artificial intelligence generated, pornographic images and videos running rampant across the internet. There have been many cases both small scale with only a few included people as well as large scale cases with large celebrities.

Even strangers can create these images or videos with as little as a few pictures online, and as of now, there are very little regulations on if and how they can use those works.

### Art Industry

The art industry has sorely been in jeopardy as artists works are fed to artificial intelligence training algorithms resulting in outputs that are "ripoffs" of the original works.

This problem is so widespread and concerning to those in the industry that a team of researchers created the tool, "Nightshade", that allows artists to poison their art to ensure that AI won't be able to properly decipher their artwork and will unintentionally get a garbage input that will only serve to confuse the algorithm.

### Scams and Fraud

There have been cases of people being tricked by online scammers that used recordings of their loved ones voices to train an AI to replicate it and fake a hostage situation in order to extort money from their target.

They can also use generative AI to create malware to infect and control other people's devices, or they can use AI to create misleading or disinformative posts to confuse and manipulate people.
