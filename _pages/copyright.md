## Does someone "own" a piece of AI art?

### What do I mean by "own"?

In this context, I consider ownership of a piece the possession of the legal copyright of that piece; the right to consider it plagarism or unlawful use if someone else uses that piece without consent.

### So, can AI art be copyrighted?

In recent history, there have been cases of people entering competitions with AI generated content: a man in Colorado entered an art competition using a generated image, a generated story was entered in a story contest, etc. 

These cases have been met with major backlash as to whether or not they should be allowed to enter, or even more worryingly, allowed to win. The main argument is that if the person hadn't put in nearly the same amount of effort to create their piece, is is truly their work? Especially if the algorithm was trained on the works of other artists.
