## Does someone "own" a piece of AI art?

### What do I mean by "own"?

In this context, I consider ownership of a piece the possession of the legal copyright of that piece; the right to consider it plagarism or unlawful use if someone else uses that piece without consent.

### So, can AI art be copyrighted?

Congress has determined that an artist may claim copyright if their work was found to be in the training data for the art generation model and even have their works removed from the model’s training data in the future; there is so much controversy in the art world about machine learning algorithms stealing their artwork to be used in training data that University of Chicago has led a team of researchers to develop a computer program called Nightshade specifically designed to “poison artificial intelligence models,” and has even been “downloaded more than 250,000 times [in five days]” (Schrader). Art theft in this manner is a great point of contention between artists and developers.

Similarly, the distinction of art being a human act was a point for Dr. Simon Hembt, a doctor of legal studies with a special focus on European law and Intellectual Property Law, who helpfully notes that according to the European Court of Justice, “a ‘work’ is an independent concept when the following two criteria are met: it must represent an original intellectual creation of its author, and only elements expressing such a creation should be considered as a ‘work,’” creating a massive precedent for the intellectual rights to generative artificial intelligence works. Given both sides devoted protection of artists rights, I would assert that there is negligible difference between effectiveness between the United States and European Union’s legislation regarding copyright and intellectual property.
