## Who

My main goal with this informative site is to help people become more aware of the potential threat that AI usage poses. Many people are acutely aware of the beneficial possibilities, but forget that its purpose is very easily modified to cause harm.

Informing people of these risks allows them to better protect themselves from bad actors online. My audience is very large becuase I find this topic to be highly applicable to everyone, but the audience that will more likely pay attention to these concerns are women, artists and writers, and the more technologically illiterate.

Women would be more concerned with the issues that I brought up since the deepfake issue disproportionately affects women more than men, and it is a very invasive form of AI misuse.

Artists and writers would be concerned because their livelihood depends on maintaining rights to their artwork as well as making sure those in power don't abuse the speed output of generative AI to create greater quanitities of lower quality work.

Finally, the technologically illiterate such as the elderly are more succeptible to scams and fraud given their general lower understanding of the speed of technological advances and capability. As a result, a simple website that would allow them to edcuate themselves on these topics would majorly help.

## What

The given cases taking place with Taylor Swift, the New Jersey students, the competition entries, and the growing AI fueled fraud industry were the greatest proponents of misuse that I wanted to tackle since I think they cause the greatest monetary and emotional damage.

## Where

These cases are popping up whereever someone can get their hands on the proper software.

The widespread prevalence of AI misuse was a major incentive for this website's creation.

The past few years since AI's introduction have been filled with
