## Who

My main goal with this informative site is to help people become more aware of the potential threat that AI usage poses. Many people are acutely aware of the beneficial possibilities, but forget that its purpose is very easily modified to cause harm.

Informing people of these risks allows them to better protect themselves from bad actors online. My audience is very large becuase I find this topic to be highly applicable to everyone, but the audience that will more likely pay attention to these concerns are women, artists and writers, and the more technologically illiterate.

Women would be more concerned with the issues that I brought up since the deepfake issue disproportionately affects women more than men, and it is a very invasive form of AI misuse.

Artists and writers would be concerned because their livelihood depends on maintaining rights to their artwork as well as making sure those in power don't abuse the speed output of generative AI to create greater quanitities of lower quality work.

Finally, the technologically illiterate such as the elderly are more succeptible to scams and fraud given their general lower understanding of the speed of technological advances and capability. As a result, a simple website that would allow them to edcuate themselves on these topics would majorly help.

## What

The given cases taking place with Taylor Swift, the New Jersey students, the competition entries, and the growing AI fueled fraud industry were the greatest proponents of misuse that I wanted to tackle since I think they cause the greatest monetary and emotional damage.

## Where

These cases are popping up whereever someone can get their hands on the proper software. There have been many cases in North America, Europe, and South Korea (from what I have researched) between creating non-consenual nude photographs, stolen artwork, and even generated child pornography. The widespread prevalence of AI misuse was a major incentive for this website's creation.

## When

The past few years since AI's introduction have been rife with AI powered devices, services, assistants, etc which has only trivialized using those services. As people have been getting more comfortable with these services, they have also become more comfortable with abusing them.

## How did I choose the format for this site?

When you first open the page, it's a landing page that is meant to act as a hook, to get your attention.

From there on, I created subsections for each of my main topics from my position essay: the threats of deepfakes, copyright, and scams.

Once I have grabbed the audience's attention, I wanted to create the least barrier for them to see the section that pertains to them, so I created individual pages that are easy to navigate to that talk about the specific person's worry. This allows the subject to see my information faster and easier.

For each page, I talk about threats from each category, but go into much less depth than my position essay had. This allows for good information to get to the reader but without being too wordy or longwinded for them to read.

On each page, I also link a youtube video from a reputable news source that will allow the subject to learn about the topic in another easy to access and understand way.

Past this, I also cite my sources as an appeal to ethos, showing my credibility by allowing my audience to factcheck my research.
