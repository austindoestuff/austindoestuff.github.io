## Taylor Swift

In late January of 2024, the pop-music superstar had AI-generated pornography generated without her consent and then released on X, formally Twitter. These pictures caused an intense push from her massive fanbase; lobbying for legislators to create legal protections as well as pushing the developers of generative AI programs to increase the restirctions on image generation.

## New Jersey High Schoolers

There was a similar case in New Jersey regarding an undisclosed student whom recieved a link of her performing in a pornographic video. A 22 year old engineering student subject to the whim of likely just a single person devastated by a decision she had no part in. In fact, after finding the video, she reported it to the police; however, AI generated content being not heavily restricted meant that no crime had technically been committed and she had no power to get it taken down.

## Deepfakes At Large

There has been a massive uptake in the amount of documented cases of AI generated deepfake content. According to Sensity AI, a company specializing in identity verification, the number of pornographic deepfakes online has "roughly doubled every six months from 2018 to 2020," and among those " 96%...feature women who didn't consent." (Compton and Hamlyn).

There has now been a lot of pressure by the public to create protection, and there has been developments in England and Wales which will criminalize the sharing of deepfakes without consent and in the United States, only a few states have laws regulating this at the moment, but there have been bills proposed in Congress to create federal regulations.
