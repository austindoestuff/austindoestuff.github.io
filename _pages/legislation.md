## AI Act: The European Union's Approach To AI Regulation

### Main Arguing Points

* AI Act separates AI usage into three categories:
   * High Risk: Very Strict Usage
      * Critical infrastructure, such as transport, since there is reasonable concern that malfuction would put the health of the citizens at risk.
      * Education: there will be no use of AI to determine who may be schooled nor will there be use when its output has lots of sway in their future, ie standardized test grading.
      * Essential Services: bank loans, citizenship, immigration, due process, etc.
      * Law enforcement
   * Limited Risk: Mostly concerning transparency in usage
      * Ensuring that people are informed when AI is used
      * AI powered telemarketing, customer service, chatbots, etc must disclose such.
      * Creations made with AI must also be readily identifiable.
   * Minimal Or No Risk: Allowed Free Usage of AI
      * AI enabled video games
      * Internet filtering
      * Most systems are in this level, being mostly busy work to make life easier.

## LSB10922: Legal Sidebar Discussing Copyright

### Main Arguing Points

* Determines the conditions for copyright to be valid for a generated work
   * The U.S. Copyright Office recognizes copyright only in works "created by a human being."
   * Generative AI works could still be copyrighted if the usage of AI was used as an assistive tool.
      * Photographs can be entitled to copyright protection where they were in control for the majority of the creative elements. Then similar to the use of photoshop, AI will be considered a tool and the copyright would still hold.

* They also talk about what generative AI is allowed to be trained on since other artists' copyrighted works. Though it is allowed under the fair use guidelines:
   * The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commerical nature or is for non profit educational purposes
   * The nature of the copyrighted work
   * The amount of substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
   * The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
* There is an argument to be made that generative AI does violate the fourth condition which would disallow its usage of other artists' works, but there hasn't been a blanket ruling yet.
