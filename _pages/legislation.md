## AI Act: The European Union's Approach To AI Regulation

### Main Arguing Points

* AI Act separates AI usage into three categories:
   * High Risk: Very Strict Usage
      * Critical infrastructure, such as transport, since there is reasonable concern that malfuction would put the health of the citizens at risk.
      * Education: there will be no use of AI to determine who may be schooled nor will there be use when its output has lots of sway in their future, ie standardized test grading.
      * Essential Services: bank loans, citizenship, immigration, due process, etc.
      * Law enforcement
   * Limited Risk: Mostly concerning transparency in usage
      * Ensuring that people are informed when AI is used
      * AI powered telemarketing, customer service, chatbots, etc must disclose such.
      * Creations made with AI must also be readily identifiable.
   * Minimal Or No Risk: Allowed Free Usage of AI
      * AI enabled video games
      * Internet filtering
      * Most systems are in this level, being mostly busy work to make life easier.
